# Game-Of-Life

This is the Game Of Life, a Turing complete game which can simulate any Turing machine.
There are three rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

Cells are simulated using filled and empty grid; filled means alive while empty means dead.
